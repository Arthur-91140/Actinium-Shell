## Overview

**ACTINIUM** is not just another shell — it's a **modular, dynamic, and hackable** command-line environment built in C++. Unlike traditional shells where commands are static binaries, ACTINIUM gives you **direct access to the source code of each command from within the terminal**, allowing you to modify, recompile, and reload them **without ever leaving the shell**.

Inspired by **Terry A. Davis** and his work on operating systems, particularly the JIT compilation concept from Holy C, Actinium brings the power of on-the-fly code modification to your terminal experience.

> *"Someone said that the smaller your duties, the better. Bad advice"* - **Terry A. Davis** (1969-2018)

## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Arthur-91140/Actinium-Shell.git
cd Actinium-Shell

# Compile the project
g++ -o actinium src/main.cpp src/command-processor.cpp src/input-handler.cpp src/history-manager.cpp src/auto-complete.cpp src/init.cpp src/config.cpp -I./src -static

# Run the shell
./actinium
```

### Building Individual Components

```bash
# Compile all source files together
g++ -o actinium \
    src/main.cpp \
    src/command-processor.cpp \
    src/input-handler.cpp \
    src/history-manager.cpp \
    src/auto-complete.cpp \
    src/init.cpp \
    src/config.cpp \
    -I./src \
    -static
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Launch the shell
./actinium

# Basic navigation
> pwd              # Show current directory
> ls [path]        # List directory contents
> cd [path]        # Change directory (supports ., .., absolute, relative paths)

# Greeting
> hello [name]     # Display welcome message

# Help and information
> help             # Show available commands
> version          # Display version information

# Exit
> exit             # Quit the shell
```

### Dynamic Command System

```bash
# Create a new command module
> create mycommand
# This generates: commands/mycommand/mycommand.cpp

# Edit the command source code
> edit mycommand
# Opens the source file in your editor

# Compile the module
> compile mycommand
# Compiles: commands/mycommand/mycommand.cpp -> mycommand.dll

# Reload the module (if already loaded)
> reload mycommand

# Use your new command!
> mycommand arg1 arg2
```

### Auto-Completion & History

```bash
# Tab completion
> cd Do[TAB]           # Completes to "Documents" if it exists
> my[TAB]              # Shows all commands starting with "my"

# History navigation
> [UP ARROW]           # Previous command
> [DOWN ARROW]         # Next command

# Real-time suggestions
# Just start typing and see suggestions appear automatically!
> hel                  # Suggests "hello" based on history
```

### Command Module Structure

Each command in ACTINIUM is an **independent DLL module** with a standardized interface:

```cpp
// commands/mycommand/mycommand.cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void execute(const std::vector<std::string>& args) {
    // Your command implementation here
    std::cout << "Hello from mycommand!" << std::endl;

    // Access arguments
    for (size_t i = 0; i < args.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << "Argument " << i << ": " << args[i] << std::endl;
    }
}
```

**Compile it:**
```bash
g++ -shared -o commands/mycommand/mycommand.dll commands/mycommand/mycommand.cpp -I./src
```

This architecture enables:
- **Hot-Reloading** - Update commands without restarting
- **Modularity** - Each command is independent
- **Customization** - Modify any command to suit your needs
- **Dynamic Loading** - Commands load on-demand

---

## Customization

### Modifying Built-in Commands

Want to change how `ls` works? Edit it!

```bash
> edit ls
# Modify the listing format, add colors, change sorting...
> compile ls
> reload ls
# Your changes are now live!
```

### Creating Custom Commands

```bash
# Generate a new command template
> create weather

# Edit it to fetch weather data
> edit weather

# Compile and use it
> compile weather
> weather Paris
```

Example weather command:
```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void execute(const std::vector<std::string>& args) {
    if (args.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Usage: weather <city>" << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    std::string city = args[0];
    // Add your weather API call here
    std::cout << "Weather for " << city << ": Sunny, 22°C" << std::endl;
}
```

### Command Reference

| Command | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `hello [name]` | Display welcome message | `hello Arthur` |
| `pwd` | Print working directory | `pwd` |
| `cd [path]` | Change directory | `cd Documents` |
| `ls [path]` | List directory contents | `ls`, `ls ..` |
| `exit` | Exit the shell | `exit` |

| `version` | Show version info | `version` |
| `create [name]` | Create new command module | `create mycommand` |
| `edit [name]` | Edit command source | `edit mycommand` |
| `compile [name]` | Compile command module | `compile mycommand` |
| `reload [name]` | Reload command module | `reload mycommand` |

### Configuration

Configuration settings are defined in `src/config.cpp`:

```cpp
const std::string HISTORY_FILENAME = "command_history.txt";
const int MAX_HISTORY_SIZE = 1000;
const int MAX_SUGGESTIONS = 5;
const int FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 50;
```

Customize these values to adjust shell behavior.
